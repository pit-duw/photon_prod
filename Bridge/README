Installation
------------

./configure --prefix=<install_directory>
make
make install

THis builds and installs the library 

  libmcfmbridge.a

and the utility 

  mcfmbridge-config

which can be used to give the link options required to 
link with applgrid and mcfm


To use, 

   mcfmbridge-config --ldflags

will produce eg 

   -u _setup_mcfmbridge_ -L<install_directory> -lmcfmbridge  -L<install_directory> -lAPPLgrid ....

which will contain *all* the linker options needed to link 
against mcfmbridge and applgrid.

Using this utility in this way is important since the -u option 
will define the _setup.._ token as undefined to force the 
setup_mcfmbridge module to be loaded from the library.

Linking this module will be enough to setup the grid interface 
functions during run time, so that linking with eg 

Within a makefile use 

LDFLAGS += $(shell mcfmbridge-config --ldflags )

In the standard mcfm makefile there is a token:

LDFLAGS

If setting this with the link options mentioned above before 
linking ...

export  MCFMBRIDGE_LDFLAGS="`mcfmbridge-config --ldflags`"

before running make in the mcfm directory will cause the 
applgrid libraries to all be linked and the full applgrid enabled
version will be built.
