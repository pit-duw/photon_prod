Hmmm, mcfm have been changing their mxpart variable between version 
6.7 and 6.8, so we have changed it in the bridge, which means that 
it will no longer work with 6.7. 

We need some way to automatically set this - because we use the common 
blocks from mcfm directly, this needs to be hard coded.

If we want to set this automatically, we will therefore need to set 
this using eg 

	-D=$(shell grep mxpart $mcfmdir/src/Inc/constants.f | grep parameter | sed 's/.*mxpart=\(.*\))/\1/')

Or we could implement some additional 

  mcfm-config 

script, so that we could eg use 

  -D=$(shell mcfm-config --mxpart )

This might be the most elegant solution.

In either case it will (unfortunately) add a dependence on the 
mcfm code directly, so it will mean that mcfm will need to be installed 
first and that we will need to add the mcfm dependence into the 
mcfm-bridge configure code.

This means that we should finally factor off the standSimple.cxx code 
into a separate package so that it does not have an implicit dependence
on the mcfm code.
